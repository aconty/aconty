                        Welcome everybody. I'm gonna be presenting our approach
                        to many lights rendering the we use in production at
                        Imageworks.

                            This is for scenes where there are too many lights
                            to iterate and shade per shading point.

                            tiny lights.

                            Otherwise we are mostly targeting this typical
                            scenerio, although this is just a procedural test
                            case with more than a quarter million lights and
                            participating media.

                    <h3>Our method</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A <b>BVH tree</b> over the lights is used for importance sampling</li>
                        <li>There is <b>no learning</b>: based on heuristics</li>
                        <li>Accounts for energy, distance and orientation, <b>not visibility</b></li>
                        <li>No grids or caches, low memory overhead</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        Like everybody else we use an acceleration tree for
                        importance sampling. We don't have grids or spatial
                        caches and therefore we don't account for visibility,
                        but we do account for distance, energy and orientation.

                    <h3>Motivation</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Originally designed for mesh lights</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They are large collections of small emitters</li>
                            <li>Avoid choosing the wrong triangle (distant or pointing away)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Usable for collections of arbitrary lights</li>
                        <li>Avoid grid/learning based methods to:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optimize time to first pixel</li>
                            <li>Reduce memory footprint and work on volumes</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        And the original motivation came because we needed an
                        efficient way to sample arbitrary mesh lights. With
                        energy based sampling, almost 50% of the time you're
                        going to pick a face facing away, and that is a thrown
                        away sample. Not to mention the distance factor when the
                        lights are big. And we realized the same approch could
                        be reused for collections of arbitrary lights.

                    <h3>Our contributions</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An approach for building the BVH of lights</li>
                        <li>An importance measure for light clusters</li>
                        <li>A split sampling method to reduce variance</li>
                    </ul>
                    <aside class="notes">
                        So our work produced three main contributions. Our tree
                        construction, the cluster importance function for
                        sampling, and a thing we called split sampling that I
                        will introduce at the end.

                        <h3>Building the tree</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Top-down approach like for raytracing</li>
                            <li>Bounding boxes are scanned in all axes for ideal split</li>
                            <li>A heuristic gives a score for each candidate</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Account for the size of the box (<b>Surface Area</b>)</li>
                                <li>Also for the <b>orientation bounds</b></li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            And I'm gonna start with the tree constraction. It
                            is a top-down method like for raytring where we are
                            going to replace the Surface Area Heuristic with our
                            own, that will use both the size of the cluster and
                            the orientation bounds. But what are the orientation
                            bounds?

                    <section>
                        <h4>Orientation bounds</h4>
                        <img data-src="img/cone.svg" class="stretch" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;">
                        <p>An axis and two angles $\theta_o, \theta_e$.
                        The latter being the emission extent from the normal:
                        $\pi/2$ for lambertian emitters, smaller for spot lights.</p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            These exist in angle space, and are meant to bound
                            the orientation features of the emitters inside a
                            cluster. Every emitter has a geometric orientation
                            and an emission spread. Our bounds are represented
                            with an axis and two angles. The first $\theta_o$
                            defines a cone where all the emitter geometric
                            orientations lie, the second $\theta_e$ is the
                            maximum emission spread. We will go more in detail
                            in a bit, but I wanted you to keep in mind what we
                            mean with this concept.

                        <h4>Size of the 3D bounding box</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Big boxes with many triangles are bad for
                            <i>raytracing</i> because the <b>probability of
                            intersection</b> is high</li>
                            <li>For us they are bad because they poorly
                            represent their members when computing
                            <b>importance</b></li>
                        </ul>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Like in raytracing we will favor small boxes but for
                            a different reason, they are better representatives
                            of their contents when measuring importance. And the
                            surface area is a good hint for it.

                            <li>We also try to keep it small because:</li>

                                <li>They will appear to affect the whole scene otherwise</li>

                            And for the same reasons we want the orientation
                            bounds as small as possible. We have a measure for
                            them related to their solid angle that we will see
                            shortly.

                        <p>Proposed cost heuristic for an $l, r$ cluster split
                        where $M_A$ is the surface area, $M_\Omega$ our
                        orientation measure and $E_l,E_r$ are the energies on
                        each side of the split.</p>
                        <p>We <b>always split in 3D world</b> axes, but taking into
                        account <b>orientation</b> measure $M_\Omega$
                        <b>for quality</b>.</p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            This is our cost heuristic, very similar to the SAH
                            but also including orientation. We balance the
                            energy instead of the number of primitives because
                            that is what drives sampling. It is good that the
                            importance is divided as close to fifty-fifty on
                            average as possible. This way we will need fewer
                            random number stretches and we'll find our emitter
                            faster.

                        <p>Left split reduces the orientation bounds</p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            We scan the three spatial axes for a split point
                            minimizing the cost. Measuring the orientation
                            bounds helps in cases like this, where the left
                            split is chosen even though by the other measures it
                            looks very similar to the one on the right. But if
                            we look at the orientation it is clearly a better
                            division. But of course this will only make a
                            difference for mesh lights and other cases where
                            there space locality implies orientation locality.

                        <img data-src="img/coneex.svg" class="stretch" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;">
                        <p>The $\theta_e$ emission part of the bounds will be
                        cosine weighted. Note our spots are just limited flat
                        emitters</p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            And what are these orientation bounds, anyway? Here
                            we see a few examples. Remember there are two
                            angles, one for the geometric orientation and
                            another for the spawn of the emission. For instance,
                            a quad light is only oriented in the normal
                            direction, but it emits in the whole hemisphere. On
                            the other hand a sphere or point is oriented
                            everywhere and the emission range is irrelevant,
                            while a spot is like a quad with a reduced emission
                            angle. This is for our particular renderer and might
                            change in other engines.

                            pick more than just one light. And we do that with
                            another heuristic. If the cluster is too big and too
                            close don't take a random light from it, go to the
                            children and sample one from each. This is repeated

                            from the shading point. As it turns out, this is
                            better than just increasing samples per pixel.

                            going stochastically so it is unbiased. This helps a
                            lot because when you have nearby 
                            lights you better shade them deterministically or
                            you'll get a lot of variance. And leave the
                            randomness to less important groups of lights.

                            We decide the split sampling with a simple guess for
                            the variance of the contributions inside a cluster.
                            We reduced it to an analitical guess for the
                            variance of the geometric term and the recorded
                            energy variance of the emitters in the cluster. This
                            expression gives you a number from zero to infinty
                            that you can easily map to a zero-one range and give
                            the user a slider to choose how aggressive the
                            splitting is. We call this light sampling rate in
                            our software.

                        <p>This scene contains 10,000 lights. On the second
                        frame split sampling is using around 20 lights per
                        shading point</p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            Our threshold mapping goes from zero, where only one
                            random light is shaded, to one, where all the lights
                            are shaded (not a good idea). In this scene there is
                            a spiral of ten thousand lights over equally as many
                            smooth objects. You can see there is a sweet spot
                            where you get a clean render in a reasonable time.
                            While the right most square, using only one light,
                            is awfully noisy. Unfortunatelly this threshold
                            changes from scene to scene, but is quite intuitive
                            to set it up so there might be an automatic way. We
                            just haven't looked into it yet.

                            increasing samples per pixel.

                            This is a stress test where we put a million lights
                            on the ceiling of a cornell box. Looks like an area
                            light but it is a point light grid as you see in the
                            zoomed detail. On the right we show a heat map

                            the split that goes from two at the bottom to almost
                            thirty on the ceiling. The image renders in just a
