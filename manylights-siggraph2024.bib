    abstract = {We propose a new hybrid method for efficiently sampling many lights
    	    on a scene that combines a simplified spatial tree with a resampling
    	    stage. Building on previous methods that work with a split or cut of
    	    the light tree, we introduce the idea of probabilistic splitting to
    	    eliminate noise boundaries. This yields a subset of lights that is then
    	    reduced to a smaller and bounded set for full light/BSDF evaluation and
    	    resampling. Our main contribution is the stochastic splitting formulation
    	    combined with a reservoir set technique which limits samples to an
    	    arbitrary number to avoid variable size collections.},
